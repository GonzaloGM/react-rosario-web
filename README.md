[React Rosario Website](https://reactrosario.netlify.com)

A site made to post all the news about the React Rosario community, upcoming meetups, blog posts from the presenters, information gathered, and so on.

This site is intended to be maintained between everyone, so every input and fixes will be welcomed!

It's built using React and generated with Gatsby.


## ⚛️ How to start developing


1.  **Install Yarn**

    Gatsby uses **yarn** as package manager, so if you don't have **yarn** installed -> [install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server**

    ```sh
    yarn develop
    ```

4.  **Start editing and adding stuff**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
